#EnhancedDiff plugin
> A Vim plugin for creating better diffs (sometimes)

This plugin allows to make use of the Patience diff algorithm for generating diffs to use with Vim. This needs the git command line tool available.

You can also customize you setup to use any other tool to generated diffs (e.g. mercurial) Read the help on how to configure the plugin accordingly.

Here are some screenshots that visualize how the patience/histogram algorithm work.

This is the default diff generated by Vim:
![Default diff](default_diff.png)

Now change that to using the "histogram" algorithm by running `:CustomDiff histogram`
and regenerating the diff using `:diffupdate`

![histogram diff](histogram_diff.png)

Note, that the Patience algorithm might not always provide better diffs. But using this plugin you can at least easily switch between different diffs.

###Installation
Use the plugin manager of your choice. Or download the [stable][] version of the plugin, edit it with Vim (`vim EnhancedDiff-XXX.vmb`) and simply source it (`:so %`). Restart and take a look at the help (`:h EnhancedDiff.txt`)

[stable]: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=

###Usage
Once installed, take a look at the help at `:h EnhancedDiff`

Here is a short overview of the functionality provided by the plugin:
####Ex commands:
    `:PatienceDiff` - Use the Patience Diff algorithm for the next diff mode
    `:CustomDiff <algorithm>`  - Use <algorithm> to generate the diff. Use any of
			       [*]myers
			       [*]default
			       [*]histogram
			       [*]patience
			       After changing the algorithm, you need to run `:diffupdate`
			       if you are in diff mode to regenerate the diff.

Note: Those 2 commands use internally git to generate the diffs.
Make sure you have at least git version 1.8.2 installed.

    `:DisableEnhancedDiff`    - Disable plugin (and use default Vim diff capabilities).
